# Segmentation-HHO_Altruism
Official MATLAB implementation of the paper titled "[**Segmentation of Brain MRI using an Altruistic Harris Hawks' Optimization algorithm**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107468)" published in Elsevier- Knowledge Based Systems ([Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08688.pdf)).

## Running the Code
Run: `main.m` to run the code on the brain MRI image data (stack the images in a `.mat` file). The dataset file for the Harvard WBA database used in our paper has been provided as `Harvard_MRI.mat`
